## Description

This homework assignment was to use the Google Books API in order to create a application that could search up a book and save it to a list to either look up the book or to delete later from the list.

## Technology

* React.js
* CSS
* JSX
* Google Books API

## Instructions

1. The home page directs you to either search up a book or to look at the saved book list.

2. If you go to the Search tab, there will be a search field to look up with the title of the book. Upon hitting the 'Search Book' button, the 'No Results' should change to 'Search Results' and the first ten results of the search you made.

3. If you wish to save any of the books, you would need to click on the 'Save Book' button and continue your searching.

4. When you would like to look at your books that have been saved, click on the Saved tab at the top of the page.

5. Once on the Saved page, you should see a list of all the books that have been saved to the database.

6. Should you feel so inclined, you are able to remove the book from the saved books list by pressing the 'Delete Book' button or to look at the book further by pressing the 'Check Out the Book!' button, which takes you to the Google Books page for that book.
